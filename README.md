============

Final project for CSE167

Authors: Jesse Bishop and Evan Carey

Controls:
* Camera direction is controlled using the mouse
* w - Move forward
* s - Move backward
* a - Strafe left
* d - Strafe right
* r - toggle between free-moving camera and on-rails camera
* t - creates a new procedurally generated city
* ESC - End program

NOTE: At this point, the program controls and hides the cursor. Therefore, it cannot be exited using the mouse. Use ESC instead.
